A sales report is a document that provides an overview of a company's sales performance over a specific period. It includes key metrics such as revenue, sales volume, top-performing products, customer trends, and comparisons against targets.

Sales reports help businesses evaluate the effectiveness of their sales strategies, forecast future revenue, and make informed decisions to improve performance. They can take various forms, including daily, weekly, monthly, or annual summaries, depending on the level of detail required
